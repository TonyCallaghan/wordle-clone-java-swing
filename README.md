### Overview:
- University assignment for CS211.
- Assignment is worth 3%.
- Additional task is worth an extra 3%.

- I wanted it to be identical as possible to Wordle. - Which was tough as swing is ancient ðŸ™‚
- Used same font (before NYT takeover), color palette and also the same words that wordle has as possible answers, which differs from words they accept.
- Program has a help window and replay function and is errorfree (As user's input is limited, just like Wordle).

## Task 2 Result:

- I added an additional text field that displays up to 3 suggestions for the user, based off of their input.
- To test this, the user can type ***'XXXXX'*** which will run a function that inputs ***'ALIEN'*** and ***'TOURS'*** and then it will enter the 1st suggestion that is based off the results of the first 2 inputs.
- The ***'XXXXX'*** function will solve the word before the attempts run out 100% of the time. ðŸ’¯
